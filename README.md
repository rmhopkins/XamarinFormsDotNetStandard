# XamarinFormsDotNetStandard
This is the standard Xamarin.Forms project template from Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 modified to use a .NET Standard library for shared code instead of a PCL or Shared Project (note it's not an actual template in the true sense, it's just a file>new project which has had no code changes, but has been updated to .NET Standard to show the project structure changes, packages required etc.)

Clone master branch for the blank solution.

The SampleApp branch implements a simple Xamarin.Forms app showing personal profiles and syncs data with an Azure App Service backend using the Azure Mobile Client and SQLiteStore packages just to add a bit more meat.
